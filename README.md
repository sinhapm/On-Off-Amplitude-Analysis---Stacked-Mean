# On-Off-Amplitude-Analysis [Stacked Mean]
**The Program performs the on-off structural amplitude profiling based on common interval stacking.**

**Scope of Program Field: Attribute Analysis based on point data set of 3D seismic data structural interpretation - Interval Based Stacked Mean Amplitude Profiling**

_** Development Platform (Windows): Visual Basic**_

_** Utility Program : Stacked_Mean (Application file) / Setup file only**_

The program carries out the mean amplitude profiling of the 3D seismic point data set based on set interval. A ratio curve can be estimated by assigning the background level and same can be analysed with the know reference curve/s (maximum of 5 reference curves can be added). Reference curve/s can be shifted, stretched, squeezed along the x -axis.

It takes columnar data sets in the ASCII file only. Images & data from the Application can be saved or exported to pre-set format.


> Some snapshots of the application is provided in the PDF file at **./Reference**

> Note: Fictitious data has been used for the display.

**References**:

A special thanks to Tim Peterson and friends who helped me for the discussion & successful utility of the program with real-field data set.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The usage of the program is limited to its scope and user has to ascertain the program output applicability to its scope of work, accuracy etc.

Any help to highlight the issue(s) and/or suggestions will be greatly appreciated. 
Thank you.
